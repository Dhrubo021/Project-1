            <p>Cars, also known as automobiles, are wheeled motor vehicles used for transportation. They typically have four wheels and are designed to run primarily on roads, accommodating one to eight people.Muscle cars are high-performance vehicles, typically American-made, with powerful engines designed for speed and acceleration. 
                They emerged in the mid-20th century and became symbols of automotive performance and cultural icons. The golden age of muscle cars began in the 1960s and continued into the early 1970s. This era saw the rise of iconic models like the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, Dodge Charger, and Pontiac GTO. 
                These cars were equipped with V8 engines, providing exceptional horsepower and torque.The oil crisis and stringent emission regulations led to a decline in muscle car production.
                 However, some models like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro continued to evolve.</p>
